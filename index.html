		<div class="page-wrap"><p>I love Beagles, they are wonderful dogs. My friend said "they are fun to play with". They are a perfect for a family dog. Back in the day, Beagles used to be up to 8 inches tall, which is why they where called "pocket dogs". Another friend Brooke said "they are pretty". This just proves that Beagles are the master dog-race :3.</p></div>

		<div class="history">
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>Beagles are one of the most popular breeds in the Western culture. This dog was first introduced in the 1870s, Illinois. They were imported here to establish a quality bloodline. As they were in America, they were breeded continuously. Beagles are most useful for hunting. Their main role is to pick up the dead ducks that drop from the air.</p>
